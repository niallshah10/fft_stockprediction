# fft_stockprediction
I attempt to predict stock prices using the Fast Fourier Transform
## Objectives
- Analyze historical stock price data using FFT.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy, yfinance
## Introduction
This project uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to predict stock prices based on historical data.
## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required packages:
1. git clone https://github.com/niallshah10/fft_stockprediction.git
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Run the notebook from the Jupyter interface to see the analysis and predictions. Parameters can be adjusted within the notebook to explore different setups.
